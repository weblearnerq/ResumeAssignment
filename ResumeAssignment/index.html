        <p>Hello, I am Sarah Q, a student at Wake Tech Community College. I have a strong interest in visual art 
          and design. Out of interest and hope to engage in this work in the future, I started to participate the 
          Graphic Design program last spring semester. I hope I can find a job related to graphic design through 
          learning in Wake Tech. Now I am a full-time student in Graphic Design program. My hobbies are making 
          small decorations, as well as hiking and cooking.</p>
        <p>I am a web beginner. So far, I took some basic web design courses. Although I don't have much experience 
          with web design, I am able to make some simple web pages to meet some basic needs, such as 
          <a href="https://wcet3.waketech.edu/huqiu1/WEB140/ASNrecipe/index.html" target="_blank">Ramen Recipe</a>.
          For me, web design is a challenge, but its novelty has always fascinated me.</p>

            <h3>Vicious Cycles</h3>
            
            <p>Vicious Cycles is a bicycle shop located in the downtown of Cary; it was formed by several bicycle 
              enthusiasts in 2015.</p>
            <p>Vicious Cycles' service philosophy is to find the best bicycles for our customers. How do we define 
              "best"? Vicious Cycles believe that the "best" is not necessarily the "most expensive", but it should 
              be high quality and durable. In addition, the most important thing about “best” is that the bicycle 
              should be suitable for specific customers, because the needs and expectations of each customer are 
              different, especially those who like bicycles. When the form and function of a bicycle fully meet 
              customer riding needs, then it is the best.</p>
            <p>Vicious Cycles provide customers with one-stop shopping services. In addition to bicycles, customers 
              can also purchase accessories in the store and get technical support and repair services. Vicious Cycles 
              delivers dozens of brands of bicycles, accessories, and equipment. If the customer are not satisfied 
              with the finished bicycles in stock, he or she can choose custom build service. Vicious Cycles' bike 
              experts will customize an exclusive bike for the customer.</p>
            <p>This project contains the Vicious Cycles' homepage and multiple sub-pages. The purpose of the website 
              is to enhance the company's brand value and to promote the sale of the product.</p>
